## Results
#### All plots of barcode / serotype proportions are here:
[02_analysis/plots/](02_analysis/plots/)

#### All supplementary tables of barcode / serotype proportions are here:
[02_analysis/tables/supplement/](02_analysis/tables/supplement/)

## Code
#### The code to count the barcodes in our FASTQ files is here:
[01_counting-barcodes/AAV-lib1/Snakefile](01_counting-barcodes/AAV-lib1/Snakefile)  
[01_counting-barcodes/AAV-lib3/Snakefile](01_counting-barcodes/AAV-lib3/Snakefile)  
These scripts can be run with [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io).

#### The R code to for calculating normalized barcode proportions and for plotting is here:
